									<h3>Domain Shifts Mitigation in Medical Cell Datasets</h3>
									<p>
										<span class="image left"><img src="images/dataset_alignment.png" alt="Domain shifts mitigation in medical cell datasets" /></span>
										<strong>Can we distinguish between a malignant cancerous cell and a healthy cell based on their image?</strong> <br/>
										Yes, but it is not easy. <br/>
										In computational cytology, we often face <em>two challenges</em>: <br/>
										• <strong>A limited amount of annotated data </strong> that prevents us from using large training cell datasets. <br/>
										• <strong>Training and testing datasets coming from different sources</strong> (microscope, light, environment, etc.)
										leading to poor generalisation and bad accuracies.
									</p>
									<br/>
									<p>
										My task was to build and design a new pipeline that would allow us to overcome these challenges. For that, I used mathematical tools,
										<strong>supervised and unsupervised machine learning methods</strong> to "re-align" datasets coming from different sources. <br/>
										Aligning dataset spaces solves both problems at once: we can map the feature
										representations of only a few annotated samples onto
										another, potentially much larger, dataset and reliably scale up annotations. <br/>
										This pipeline greatly improved generalization across data and
										enhances cell classification results (between <strong>+20% and +50% improved accuracy</strong> depending on the dataset). <br/>
										On top of that, I deployed the pipeline through a mini web app to help researchers run cell classification tasks.

									<h3>CMI Sensors | Kaggle Competition</h3>
									<p>
										<span class="image left"><img src="images/cmi_competition_kaggle.png" alt="CMI Sensors Kaggle competition" /></span>
										A challenge proposed by the <strong>Child Mind Institute</strong> and
										the <strong>Healthy Brain Network</strong>. The goal was to detect
										repetitive gesture behaviors from time series sensor data
										acquired by a wrist-worn device. These behaviors are
										connected to obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), and
										thus represent key indicators of mental health challenges.
									</p>
									<br/>
									<br/>
									<p>
										I designed a 3-branch pipeline with <strong>PyTorch</strong> and <strong>attention mechanisms</strong> to classify gestures.
										After training, the model achieved an accuracy of <strong>82.8%</strong>, placing me in the <strong>top 10%</strong> of the competition.
									</p>

										<strong>Results: 186th out of 2,657 teams</strong>

									<h3>AI and Quantum Computing</h3>
									<p>
										<span class="image left"><img src="images/AI_quantum_computing.jpg" alt="AI and Quantum Computing" /></span>
										<strong>Is it possible to build a quantum computer with light?</strong> <br/>
										Yes. <br/>
										<strong>Is it better than a classical computer?</strong> <br/>
										In principle, yes! <br/>
										But, there is a <em>condition</em>: light needs to have a very specific and fundamental property 
										to quantum physics called <strong><em>entanglement</em></strong>. <br/>
										However it is very difficult, if not impossible, to detect it experimentally since it relies on data-hungry and computationally expensive methods.
									</p>
									<p>
										The goal of the project was to develop a <strong>neural network pipeline to detect such fundamental property</strong> only from a few experimental data.
										Indeed, entanglement can be witnessed from correlations patterns that experimentalists can observe from their measurements. And we know that neural networks are excellent at detecting correlations.
										It was thus tempting to use a neural network to detect such fundamental property. <br/>
										My role was to supervise the project and work together with a PhD student to develop the pipeline. <br />
										We obtained excellent and very promising results. 
										We were impressed by the performance of the neural network at this task reaching more than <strong>95% of accuracy</strong> on the test dataset and <strong>only with four different measurements</strong>.
										This is a strong milestone in the field of quantum computing and it was awarded by a publication in the prestigious journal Physical Review Letters.

									<h3>Bringing Sport and AI Together</h3>

												<strong>Can artificial intelligence help us write workout gym notes efficiently to easily track our progress?</strong>
											</p>
											<p>
												This project started with a <strong>personal need</strong>. When I go to the gym, I need to take notes 
												to track my weights, my reps, my number of sets and my exercises. It is a <strong>must</strong> for anyone 
												who wants to track their progress and improve their performance. If you do not do it, you won't
												progress simply because you cannot remember everything from one workout to the next. <br/>
												However, taking notes can be time-consuming and I never found a good app that would help me do it efficiently.
												If you download such apps, you will realize that you need to look for specific exercise 
												and enter all details (reps, weights, sets, ...) manually.  <br/>
												You cannot really do that when you are at the gym! I don't have time! 
												I just want to be able to write <em>'Bench press 100x10 4S'</em> (understand: 'I did 4 sets of 10 reps at 100kg') and have it automatically 
												<strong>converted</strong> to a structured format to be able to track my progress. <br/>
												<br/>
												This is what I did and I called my app <strong>FitBoard Training</strong>.
